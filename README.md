# Flights scraper

I'm learning C# so I decided to do a small project that consists in scraping different travel companies, and get the prices of the flights, and finally send the results by telegram.

## Enviroment

I will use as my development enviroment:

- Linux
- VSCode
- Dotnet core

## Where to get the data

You can get Ryanair data from <https://www.ryanair.com/api/booking/v4/es-es/availability>.
